# InvitLED
Final project (customizable light up jacket with GUI) for ES50

1. Turn Arduino on and connect via Bluetooth to your computer
2. Run `python ui.py`
3. Create a custom design for your clothes!

Details:  
After running `python ui.py`, you will see a GUI of a 13x13 grid.  
Each button corresponds to an addressable RGB LED on the jacket.   
Cycle through color options (R, O, Y, G, B, P, None) by clicking the button.  
Choose from preset designs (a rainbow, a tree, a heart, a surprise).  
Toggle flash on/off in the UI to affect the display of lights on the grid.  
Want to restart your design? Click CLEAR. 

When you are ready to upload your design to the jacket, click SEND!  
The data will be transferred via Bluetooth to the Arduino in the jacket.  

See your design instantly and be "invitLED" to all of the parties!
